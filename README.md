# Project Repository for CS6400-2021-01-Team104

Read the following to get started:

1. Installing git:  
    On macOS:  
        $ brew install git  

2. Create a personal access token:  
    https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

3. Check if your git will handle your credentials:  
    https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git

4. Clone the repository:
    On the command line:
        $ git clone https://github.gatech.edu/cs6400-2021-01-spring/cs6400-2021-01-Team104.git

5. Start editing files.  
    For code, I use VSCode, which has editing, git integration and the ability to have plugins for additional features.  
    For non-code, e.g. documents that we need to submit as PDFs, we can use any editor, e.g. Word 365 or Google Docs (*this line to be updated once team decides on preferred approach*)  

6. Commit your changes to git and push to the repository:  
    You can keep committing your changes as you make them and reach milestones. The commits will be stored in your local copy of the repository.  
    When you 'push' using git, the changes you made get transferred to this repository, and are accessible by others.  
    If there is a conflict betwen what you are pushing and what others have pushed previously, git will let you know and allow you to resolve the conflicts.
